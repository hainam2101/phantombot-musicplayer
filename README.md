## Requirements

As written above its programmed in C#. It will be working on windows well. For other operating systems you need to emulate the program (on Linux for example with Mono, not tested yet).

You need to have installed **.NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher** on your system to use it.

## Installation

You can download the current version directly on [GitHub here](https://github.com/promarcel/phantombot-musicplayer/releases).

After download and unzip it move the folder to the location on your drive you want. Now it's time to start: Execute the "PB-MusicPlayer.exe" file.

Time for configuration: To setup the program you need your PhantomBot credentials and host both.
